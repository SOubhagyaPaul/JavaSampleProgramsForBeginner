 * The Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Ceasar to securely communicate with
his generals. Each letter is replaced by another letter N position down the English alphabet. For
example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'. In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates
and it is transformed into a 'd'.Write a methods that return a lambda expression implement a decoder for
the CeasarCipher where N = 5.
